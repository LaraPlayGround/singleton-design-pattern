# LaraStack - Singleton Design Pattern

Welcome to LaraStack, your one-stop destination for mastering software design patterns! In this topic, we will delve into the Singleton Design Pattern, a fundamental pattern that ensures your applications have only one instance of a class.

## What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational pattern that guarantees a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. By using this pattern, we can control the instantiation of a class, ensuring that it's shared across the application and preventing unnecessary multiple instances.
